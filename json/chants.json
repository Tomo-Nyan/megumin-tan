["Darkness blacker than black and darker than dark, I beseech thee, combine with my deep crimson.\nThe time of awakening cometh.\nJustice, fallen upon the infallible boundary,\nappear now as an intangible distortion!\nDance, Dance, Dance!\nI desire for my torrent of power a destructive force: a destructive force without equal! Return all creation to cinders, and come from the abyss!\nThis is the mightiest means of attack known to man, the ultimate attack magic!\nEXPLOSION!\n"]
